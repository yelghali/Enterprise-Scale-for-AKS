## Architecting for High Availability & Resiliency

![Plan Backup Restore](./media/plan_backup_restore.png)

## High Availability Considerations
* **AKS Cluster Configuration**:
	- Enable [Uptime SLA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/uptime-sla) for production workloads
	- Use [Availability Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/availability-zones) (with Standard Load Balancer)
	- Use [multiple node pools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools) spanning AZs
	- Enforce [Resource Quotas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-scheduler#enforce-resource-quotas) and Plan for [pod disruption budgets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-scheduler#plan-for-availability-using-pod-disruption-budgets)
	- Control Pod scheduling using [Taints & Tolerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#provide-dedicated-nodes-using-taints-and-tolerations), & [Pod Affinity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#control-pod-scheduling-using-node-selectors-and-affinity)



* **Applications**: 
  - Configure applications [requests & limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/developer-best-practices-resource-management#define-pod-resource-requests-and-limits)
  - to ensure pod replicas are spread evenly across zones : Use Pod Topology Aware Scheduling 
  - to ensure the PVs are located in the same zone as the pods:
     - Use Volume Binding Mode: WaitForFirstConsumer
     - Use StatefulSets
     - Use Zone-Redundant (ZRS) Disks (preview)
   - to optimally route traffic within the same zone to avoid unnecessary latency: 
      - Use Service Topology (deprecated in Kubernetes 1.21, +, feature state alpha)
      - Use Topology Aware Hints (from Kubernetes 1.21+, feature state alpha)


* **Data**: 
Storage Class Configuration (used to create dynamic peristent volumes)
	- Use CSI Driver as it is the standard provider for exposing storage to applications running on Kubernetes
	- Use Azure Disk with ZRS (currently in Preview) --> available via Azure Disk CSI Driver
	- Use Azure File with ZRS


## Disaster Recovey Considerations

* Plan for Disaster Recovery
	-  Prepare Cluster & POD Identities
	- Plan network segmentation & DNS resolution
	- Prepare storage location in DR Region to store backups

	- Prepare Cluster Node Pools :
	  - Create Nodes & re-deploy Node Configuration
	  -  Use [Node Pool Snapshot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/node-pool-snapshot) (currently in Preview with [limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/node-pool-snapshot#limitations))


	-  Prepapre Applications Persistent volumes : 
	  -  Prepare StorageClasses & VolumeSnapshotClasses (naming, sku, topology aware configuration, binding mode)


* Run a Drill Tests:
	* Create secondary AKS ecosystem (ACR, Keyvault, App Gateway, Firewall, NSG)
	* Create secondary AKS Cluster (with its dependencies installed: aad-podid, velero, csi-drivers) + RBAC for Azure services & velero identity (backup tool)

	To restore **Stateless** Application: 
	* Redeploy Application Configuration using Devops CICD

	To restore **statefull** Application, you need to backup and restore:
	* Cluster configuration (storage classes, volumesnapshotclasses, technical pods)
	*  Persistent Volumes (Azure Disk & Azure Fileshare)
	*  Application Configuration (bound to the restored persistent volumes)
